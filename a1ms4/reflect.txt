1. Briefly explain why you think this assignment has asked you to code a struct, contact, that holds tree other structs
as data members.

Nesting structs (Name, Address, Numbers) under the new struct Contacts allow us to bring all three perivously 
declared sturctures under one structure in "contacts.h" file. later by including this hearder file in "a1ms4.c" file,
we can declare a new vriable "X" of type struct Contacts in our "a1ms4.c" file and finally pass the values stored in 
each variable under substructs (Name, Address, Numbers) to a function just by passing the name of the new vairable "X"
follow by a dot "." and the name of the variable that we need to access it's data.

2. What was the most difficult part of this assignment? Undestanding the instuction. 

3. How long did it take you to complete milestone 4? 2 Hours.
