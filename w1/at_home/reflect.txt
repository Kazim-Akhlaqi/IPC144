By completing this project, I have learnt how to use nled text editor to create
a text file in linux environment.
I also leant how to write a program in C languge, compile and run it in linux.
Although I have used different IDE application like Visual Studio to create
a C project but creating a C project in linux was quite a new experiance.

Thank you,
