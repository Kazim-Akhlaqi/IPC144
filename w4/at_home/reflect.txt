Workshop: Wk04 Array in_lab

1) In one or two snetences explain why the arrays in this program have to be declared to hold 10 element?
In this workshop we want to sotre the information for the high and low temperature of maximum 4 days but since the 
the range of number of days we are allowed to choose is from 3 to 10, we declare the zise of arras to 10 to have
enough storage to save the temparature information of 10 days.

2) In two or three sentence explain the advantages and disadvantage of using matching arrays?
Advantage: Parallel or matching arrays makes easier to store tabular information. As we use the same index to match 
the data of two arryas through refering to same the index.
Disadvantage: Since in parallel arrays with use the same index to refer to values of each array, we might get the
the wrong output if don't enter the data in the exact sequence we want to sotre.

3) Was the at home portion of this workshop too easy, just right or too hard? Why?
The home portion was quite challenging and it took me to test differrent iteration method to get the right
output and specifically, although I had defined the _crt_secure_no_warnings pragma but I still had a big
strucgle with scanf function during the compile time.
