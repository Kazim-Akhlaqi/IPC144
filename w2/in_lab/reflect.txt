1- What do think is the most important thing you learned in this workshop?
I learnt how to declare vaiables of intergral and floating types in c language,
I aslo learnt how to do simple math calculation with C operatros and expressions
as well as using the Scanf to get the data from user and I learnt how to cast the type of a value or variable.

2- Why must you add .005 to the value derived when calculating the GST owing?
We add .005 To the value derived when calculation the GST to round the value for GST to 1.13.
GST = amountOwing * .13 + .005; which adding .005 to GST result in 1.13334 and the final amount will be roundedd to 1.13.

3- What is the result of a casting operation?
the casting operation converts type of a variable or value to another type and in this project the porpoes of casting is to convert the 
decimal value (float) to integer.

4- Why do you think you were required to use the modulus operator in this workshop?
We use the modulue in this workshop to display to remainder value ofte each division operation.
