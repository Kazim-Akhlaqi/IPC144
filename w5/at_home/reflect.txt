1) In two or tree senetences discuss the advantages of using an array of structs versus parallel arrays when dealing
   with related data:
   Some of the advantages of using an array of structs versus parallel arrays are, first, it requires to write shorter	
   and better code. second, decaling related data under on struct make is more efficient use of computer resousece and
   Third, it easir to update the data of multiple arrays by only refering to one index number and, Fourth, we can pass
   the data of a structure to a function only by passing the structure name. 

2) The preferred method of declaring a struct data type is in a header file. Briefly explain why?
   Declaring a struct type in a header file makes all structure's elements golbal to the rest of source code which this
   method allows all the elements in source file to have access to sturctures data. this method is aslo makes updating
   and debugging of the code easier.
